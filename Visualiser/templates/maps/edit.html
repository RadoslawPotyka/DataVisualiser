                        First upload a file and choose the row at which Visualiser will be able to find columns
                        and choose the separator for your file (if it's an excel or json file just leave the field as it
                        is.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then you'll be able to personalise your map by typing it's description, title, the columns by
                        which
                        we should display the map and add layers each of which will be a different, personalised shape
                        that
                        will be displayed on your map.
